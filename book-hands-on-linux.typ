This book is the practical companion to _The Agentic Crew_. Where the main book explains the ideas, this one puts them into practice.

Each chapter is an exercise. You'll set up real tools, work with real repositories, and build real things — starting from scratch. The exercises are written for Linux (Ubuntu-based examples — adapt for your distribution).

You don't need to be a programmer. You do need to be willing to type commands into a terminal and see what happens. That's how you learn this stuff — not by reading about it, but by doing it.

By the end of this book, you'll have a working development environment, hands-on experience with Git and GitHub, and the confidence to collaborate on real projects using AI agents as your co-pilot.
